To learn more, I highly recommend the book by Michael Nielsen
http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning....
The book walks through the code behind the example in these videos, which you can find here:

MNIST database:

Also check out Chris Olah's blog: 
http://colah.github.io/
His post on Neural networks and topology is particular beautiful, but honestly all of the stuff there is great.

And if you like that, you'll *love* the publications at distill:

For more videos, Welch Labs also has some great series on machine learning:

"But I've already voraciously consumed Nielsen's, Olah's and Welch's works", I hear you say.  Well well, look at you then.  That being the case, I might recommend that you continue on with the book "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville.

Thanks to Lisha Li (@lishali88) for her contributions at the end, and for letting me pick her brain so much about the material.  Here are the articles she referenced at the end:
